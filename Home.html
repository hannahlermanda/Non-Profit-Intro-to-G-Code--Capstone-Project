            <p>Since 1993, A Place Called Home has made it its mission to provide the canvas for South Central youth to mold their futures with purpose.
               APCH strives to provide resources and opportunities for at-risk young people and their families, so that they are empowered to take control of their lives.
               Since our founding and our original 12 members, we have grown and served over 20,000 youths and their families in the South Central area.
               We are determined to continue helping the future thrive through the investment in our children and their families.

            <h3>APCH fosters us even though we come from a tough neighborhood.
                <em>Anything</em> is possible with hard work, mentorship, and community.</h3>
            <h3>-Cindy Diaz, APCH Alumni</h3>
            <p>A Place Called Home serves youth ages 8-24 and their family by providing resources that contribute to their holistic growth and development.
               Residents of the community we serve are historically under-resourced and face adverse challenges, such as high unemployment and crime rates and low graduation rates and income.
               APCH gives developing youth a safe place to come to provide resources and a supportive community that encourages them to foster their dreams and talents to fruition for lifelong success and happiness.
