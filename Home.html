            <br>
            <h3>"I really want to start a place for all the children to go to - to <em>be</em> safe, to <em>feel</em> safe."</h3>
            <h3>-Debrah Constance, Founder</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Since 1993, A Place Called Home has made it its mission to provide the canvas for South Central youth to mold their futures with purpose.
               APCH strives to provide resources and opportunities for at-risk young people and their families, so that they are empowered to take control of their lives.
               Since our founding and our original 12 members, we have grown and served over 20,000 youths and their families in the South Central area.
               We are determined to continue helping the future thrive through the investment in our children and their families.
