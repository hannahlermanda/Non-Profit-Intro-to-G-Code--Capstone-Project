            <br>
            <p>Since 1993, A Place Called Home has made it its mission to provide the canvas for South Central youth to mold their futures with purpose.
               APCH strives to provide resources and opportunities for at-risk young people and their families, so that they are empowered to take control of their lives.
               Since our founding and our original 12 members, we have grown and served over 20,000 youths and their families in the South Central area.
               We are determined to continue helping the future thrive through the investment in our children and their families.

            <h3>APCH fosters us even though we come from a tough neighborhood.
                <em>Anything</em> is possible with hard work, mentorship, and community.</h3>
            <h3>-Cindy Diaz, APCH Alumni</h3>
            <p>A Place Called Home serves youth ages 8-24 and their family by providing resources that contribute to their holistic growth and development.
               Residents of the community we serve are historically under-resourced and face adverse challenges, such as high unemployment and crime rates and low graduation rates and income.
               APCH gives developing youth a safe place to come to provide resources and a supportive community that encourages them to foster their dreams and talents to fruition for lifelong success and happiness.

                    <p>Da Vinci Rise at APCH is a high school for the most at-risk youth in the community, including those in the foster care system, who have been incarcerated, who struggle with housing, that have had their academic journies disrupted for whatever reason.
                       At this school, youth can recover credits, obtain a high school diploma, prepare for college, participate in internships, receive counseling, and get the support they need to build the foundations for their future.

                <h4>Art, Music, Dance, and other Creative Expressions Program</h4>
                    <p>In our creative arts program, we encourage our members's social and emotional growth through the use of their imaginations and talents in an art program of their choice.
                       We have class in fine arts (painting, drawing, etc.), dance, digital arts (including video), photography, music, music production and technology, poetry, theater, and fashion design.
                       APCH has invested in state of the art equipment and staff and created partnerships in order to offer the best tools for our youth to have a positive outlet for their artistic expressions and start their potential professional careers.

                <h4>Community Engagement and Outreach</h4>
                    <p>We believe that a community's success and child's growth go hand-in-hand. 
                       At APCH, we focus on supporting the community by providing basic necessities, career development, classes, and other resources to uplift and develop our people.
                       We also teach our youth the importance of giving back to the community by providing them with opportunities to volunteer and/or assist other members through APCH.

                    <p>Da Vinci Rise at APCH is a high school for the most at-risk youth in the community, including those in the foster care system, who have been incarcerated, who struggle with housing, that have had their academic journies disrupted for whatever reason.
                       At this school, youth can recover credits, obtain a high school diploma, prepare for college, participate in internships, receive counseling, and get the support they need to build the foundations for their future.
